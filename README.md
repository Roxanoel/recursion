# Recursion
Recursion exercises for The Odin Project. 

# Exercise 1: 
Using iteration, write a function fibs which takes a number and returns an array containing that many numbers from the fibonacci sequence. Using an example input of 8, this method should return the array [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13].
Now write another method fibsRec which solves the same problem recursively. This can be done in just a couple of lines (or 1 if you’re crazy, but don’t consider either of these lengths a requirement… just get it done).

# Exercise 2: 
Build a function mergeSort that takes in an array and returns a sorted array, using a recursive merge sort methodology.

# Testing
I have included my jest test files. To use, simply install Jest in npm, and run your preferred test command. All tests were passed in this last commit.
